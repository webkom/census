Headcount for our servers. It is a little web project based on express.js, which
lists servers based on pings to its API. The servers themselves need to report
to be shown in the list. However, it is not necessary to attach more than hostname
and a username in the POST request.

### Reporting
```bash
curl -X POST http://census.abakus.no/api/report --data "hostname=<hostname>&username=<username>"
```

## Setup
```bash
git clone git@github.com:webkom/census.git
cd census
npm install
gulp
```

## Tests
```bash
mocha
```
